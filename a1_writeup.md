# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
It's definitely a nice change from using Java every day in APCSA last year. I like that it offers a wider selection of built-in functions to allow solving problems faster.



2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
I've mainly used Java at school before and this definitely has a lot of differences, mainly a more simple readable syntax and being dynamically typed. It's a bit more similar to other languages I've used like Javascript, which is also dynamically types and has a relatively simple syntax compared to Java.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned more about how to shape a ChatGPT prompt to get the answers you want and it was a good refresher for my algorithmic thinking skills.
